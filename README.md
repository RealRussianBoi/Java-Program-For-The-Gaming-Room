# Java-Program-For-The-Gaming-Room
A java program commissioned by The Gaming Room. 

1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a small company developing a game called Draw It or Lose, loosely similar to the 1980s television game Win, Lose or Draw, where teams compete to guess what is being drawn. Rather than a player drawing images on an easel to help team members guess the puzzle (a phrase, title, or thing), the application had to render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. A game consists of four rounds of play lasting one minute each. Drawings are rendered at a steady rate and are fully complete at the 30-second mark. If the team does not guess the puzzle before time expires, the remaining teams have an opportunity to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15-second time limit.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

With my strong understanding of operating systems I helped The Gaming Room with directing their attention and budget to the best operating system on which to host their platform, as well as helped with allocating server storage. 

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document provided helped me develop the necessary code by outlining clear standards and requirements expected of the end result. 

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think my code was perfect and does not need to be improved. 

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs through the Software Design Template, which clearly outlined the specifications and criteria expected of the program. It was important to consider the user's needs when designing because the existance of unpleasant nuanced or errors within the program which would impede the user's experience could deter them from returning to the Draw It Or Lose It application. 

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software with full seriousness in order to leave The Gaming Room satisfied with my work. A strategy I would use to design a similar application in the future would be distributing my work into sections, which I would then compare to the Software Design Template to prevent me from rewriting my code in the case that it does not satisfy the overall criteria.
